### Hey, this is my corner of the internet.  

Nowadays, I spend my time thinking about **AI-generated code**—how to make it reliable, maintainable, and not a mess. I’ve seen firsthand how unchecked AI-generated changes can turn clean codebases into compounded technical debt.  

The reality is that AI is changing how we build software, generating more code than ever. But speed without safeguards leads to chaos. Codebases are evolving faster than teams can manage, and without the right checks, AI-driven development will quickly spiral out of control.  

This isn’t some distant problem—it’s happening now. Companies are already struggling to integrate AI into real-world engineering workflows while keeping their systems scalable and maintainable.  

I’m focused on solving this, making sure AI is a tool that empowers engineers—not another source of complexity.  

The future of AI-driven development is inevitable—what we do now will define whether it fuels progress or creates new burdens.  

⚡ If this resonates, we should chat. I'm a believer in collaboration, together we can continue to make the huge strides that got us here.

**Tech I'm working with:** Go, TypeScript, Node
