I'm working on AI code governance.

AI is changing how we build software, generating more code than ever, but that speed comes with real challenges. Codebases are evolving faster than teams can manage, and without the right safeguards, AI-generated changes will quickly spiral into technical debt.

This isn’t a future problem. It’s happening now. Companies are already struggling to integrate AI into real-world engineering workflows while keeping their systems scalable, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.

I’m focused on solving this, ensuring AI becomes a tool for engineers rather than another source of complexity.
