### Hey, this is my corner of the internet.  

Nowadays, I spend my time thinking about **AI-generated code**—how to make it reliable, maintainable, and not a mess.  

AI is changing how we build software, generating more code than ever. But speed without safeguards leads to chaos. Codebases are evolving faster than teams can manage, and without the right checks, AI-driven development will spiral out of control.  

This isn’t a distant problem—it’s happening now. Companies are already struggling to integrate AI into real-world engineering workflows while keeping systems scalable and maintainable.  

⚡ Imagine a future where engineers and AI work together to build systems that don’t just ship fast but stand the test of time.  

I’m working on solving this through **AI-assisted code governance.** If this resonates, we should chat!  

**Tech I'm working with:** Go, TypeScript, Node
