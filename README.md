Nowadays, I spend my time thinking about **AI-generated code**—how to make it reliable, maintainable, and not an unmaintainable mess. I’ve seen firsthand how AI-generated changes, left unchecked, turn clean codebases into tangled complexity of technical debt.  

AI is changing how we build software, generating more code than ever, but that speed comes with real challenges. Codebases are evolving faster than teams can manage, and without the right safeguards, AI-generated changes will quickly spiral into technical debt.

This isn’t a future problem. It’s happening now. Companies are already struggling to integrate AI into real-world engineering workflows while keeping their systems scalable, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.

I’m focused on solving this, ensuring AI becomes a tool for engineers rather than another source of complexity.
