### Hi there 👋

Somehow you've landed on my page!

Well here it is...

I'm currently building emergency response software at RapidSOS 🚔 🚒 🚑.

Anything you find here is likely code I've written for fun and in tradition with the early days of GitHub and OSS.

Feel free to use anything you find, it should all be MIT Licensed. Cheers 🍻.
