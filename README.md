### Hi there 👋

Somehow you've ended up on my page!

Well here it is...

I like building anything (and everything) that has actual use in the 🌎. I'm currently working at RapidSOS building mission critical emergency software 🚔 🚒 🚑 .

Anything you find in my repos is likely code I've written for fun and in tradition with the early days of GitHub and OSS. Cheers 🍻 to the legend `_why`, who inspired me to lose my fear of sharing things in the open.
